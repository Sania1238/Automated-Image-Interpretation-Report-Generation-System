CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation for suspected COVID-19 pneumonia

TECHNIQUE: Standard chest radiography

FINDINGS: The chest radiograph demonstrates findings consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia (AI confidence: {confidence:.1%}). Bilateral ground-glass opacities are observed, predominantly in the peripheral and lower lobe distribution. The pattern is characteristic of viral pneumonia with COVID-19 features. The cardiac silhouette appears normal in size and contour. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Radiographic findings highly suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia with bilateral peripheral ground-glass opacities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. RT-PCR testing for COVID-19 confirmation and clinical correlation
2. Patient isolation per institutional COVID-19 protocols
3. Follow-up chest imaging in 7-10 days or if clinical condition deteriorates
4. Consider chest CT for better characterization if symptoms worsen
5. Monitor oxygen saturation and respiratory status closely

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Clinical correlation with symptoms and vital signs
